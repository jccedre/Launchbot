# Launchbot

## Description

Launchbot enables you to easily open sets of all your favorite websites with just one click.

It's like restoring tabs, but on every device and browser. You can also search the web or just quick-launch one of your favorite websites.

> Note: I started working on v3, which comes with an easier config. The instruction below is for the v2 release. If you check out the current code base you can configure Launchbot completely in config.js. Next-up new UI!
